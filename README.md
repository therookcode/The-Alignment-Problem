# The-Alignment-Problem
The Alignment Problem explores the future of social engineering. You are the only human on a spaceship run by 4 AI Agents. One of them has hallucinated a killer personality. Using Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, the game generates dynamic dialogue, consistent alibis, and real-time deception. Can you outsmart the model?
